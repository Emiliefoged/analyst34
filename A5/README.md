# Your Learning Experience for the Concept You Focused On
## Identify Your Own Level at the Beginning of This Course and Where You Ended
- At the start of the course, our knowledge about OpenBIM tools and their applications was fairly limited. We have had the course BIM almost 2 years ago, and the use of it was therefore a bit far away in our memory. At the end of this course, we feel we’ve gained a much better understanding of how these tools can be used, particularly for collaborative workflows and extracting useful data from IFC files.

## What Else Do You Still Need to Learn?
- We thought that it could be nice if we have had learned how to use voxels to calculate the volumes in the model.

## How You Might Use OpenBIM in the Future?
- OpenBIM could be highly relevant in future professional projects, especially for improving collaboration and ensuring data interoperability in complex design and construction workflows.


# Your Process of Developing the Tutorial
## Did the Process of the Course Enable You to Answer or Define Questions That You Might Need Later for Thesis?
- Yes, the course helped identify key questions about data extraction (especially how to extract volumes from the IFC-files), tool interoperability, and efficient workflows that could be relevant for future research or thesis work.

## Would You Have Preferred to Have Been Given Less Choice in the Use Cases?
- The freedom in the task was exciting but also made it challenging to figure out exactly how to approach the problem. A bit more structure in the use cases could have been helpful at times, as it was a bit uncertain if we had the right approach for the task.

## Was the Number of Tools for the Course Ok? Should We Have More or Less? If So, Which Ones Would You Leave Out?
- The number of tools was generally manageable, but some of the tools/methods we used in A2 and A4 could have been more properly introduced, which made it a bit confusing at times to understand exactly what was required. With that said, we think that the number of tools was generally manageable.
- In the beginning, we found it quite difficult to understand the connection between our repositories, Python/Visual Studio Code, and GitHub Desktop, and how they worked together. However, after completing Assignment 2 and actively using these tools multiple times, we started to get the hang of it and felt more confident navigating and integrating them into our workflow.


# Summary of the Feedback You Received on Your Tutorial
## Did the Tool Address the Use Case You Identified?
- We found that the tool didn’t fully address the use case we initially identified in A2. We had to make some adjustments, especially with the IFC model, as it didn’t include volumes, which was a crucial element for our project. Initially, we aimed to work with construction materials, but we ended up focusing solely on floor materials. We also planned to load material data, but we ran into difficulties finding data with the specific unit we needed. This would have required some conversions, which our coding skills weren’t quite advanced enough to handle.

# (Individually) Your Future for Advanced Use of OpenBIM
## S203742	
### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
I’m not entirely sure yet, but it’s possible if my thesis involves areas where OpenBIM tools can provide value, such as collaborative design or sustainability analysis.

### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professional life in the next 10 years?
It seems likely, considering OpenBIM’s growing importance in ensuring interoperability and efficiency in construction and design projects. I am likely to work in fields where OpenBIM tools could play a key role in my work.

### Conclude the journey through A1-A5
The journey through A1-A5 has been both exciting and challenging at times. It was fun to work with new tools and workflows, but also a bit overwhelming at times since I had never coded directly in Blender before or used GitHub. Additionally, extracting data from IFC files turned out to be much more complex than I initially expected, which added another layer of difficulty. Overall, it was a really good learning experience that provided me with new insights and skills to build on for future projects.

## S203711
### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
If it has a relevance for the subject I choose then I would be open to apply OpenBIM tools. But it would have to be a simple problem because I’m still not totally confident in coding.

### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
Yes, OpenBIM is a great tool for designing and it would be likely that i come across it in my professional life.
### Conclude the journey through A1-A5
The journey through the assignments was interesting and challenging. We didn’t have experience with the method of coding and implementing it in a BIM model, but I learned a lot. The project we chose was challenging but I think we did a good job figuring everything out and learning how to use the tools to calculate the carbon footprint of materials. It was always an accomplishment when something worked out as we spend a lot of time on trying to complete it. It was a great learning experience and I now know a lot more about OpenBIM.

## S204847	
### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
If it is relevant, I would be happy to use OpenBIM since it is a good tool for collaboration and data exchange across different software platforms. This could enhance the accuracy and efficiency of documenting or analysing a building.

### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
Yes, I believe OpenBIM is a useful tool for collecting and organizing information about buildings.

### Conclude the journey through A1-A5
When we came up with the idea of calculating the carbon footprint (CO2) using the volumes for different materials, I didn’t anticipate how challenging it would be to create a code that could calculate these volumes. We tried various methods and also experimented with Voxel, but we were unsuccessful. Then we decided that the model should already include the material volumes as input. 
What stood out to me during this process was how making the code more specific made it easier to work with.
